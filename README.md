## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

### C Example

```c
int main() {
  int y = SOME_MACRO_REFERENCE;
  int x = 5 + 6;
  cout << "Hello World! " << x << std::endl();
}
```

### C++ Example

```cpp
int main() {
  int y = SOME_MACRO_REFERENCE;
  int x = 5 + 6;
  cout << "Hello World! " << x << std::endl();
}
```

## Table

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
